### Production implementation assignment
For each production implementation assignment, please implement your production according to the following guidelines:
- Place it in package `productions`.
- Name it `ProductionN` where `N` is production number.
- Make it implement `Production` interface.
- Add it to `Productions.productions` array.
- Unit-test the production.
- You can implement a processor to test some production sequence (name it `AssignmentNProcessor` where `N` is a number of production that you are testing).

### Assignments from A to D
For each of these assignments, please implement the productions that are not already there, then please implement a proper processor according to the following guidelines:
- Place it in package `processing`.
- Name it `AssignmentNProcessor` where `N` is assignment letter.
- Make it implement `Processor` interface.
- Add it to `Processors.processors` array.
